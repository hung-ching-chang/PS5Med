## PS5Med: MEDiation analysis using Partial Sum Statistic and Sample Splitting Strategy

PS5Med is an R package for high-dimensional mediation analysis, including two methods (`PS5` & `PS5.multisplit`). While `PS5` performs the fast operation by single sample split, `PS5.multisplit` provides more robust mediation analysis by multi sample split. The figure below shows the framework of our method.
